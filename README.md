Hello there dear reader, my name is Ryan, and I am an aspiring Data analyst! I currently reside in Ridgeland MS and am self-employed.
I'm a Courtesy Officer for my apartment complex and a Remotask tasker. For my first position, I'm in my car for the duration of my shift, and I monitor my 
apartment complex for anything suspicious. I notify authorities if needed and also help out residents if they need assistance with anything. As for my other position,
I train various AI models by reviewing their answers to prompts and explain ways they can improve/compare them with other models when there is more than one involved with a prompt.

- My interests are sort of all over the place as of late, but to keep it short, I enjoy gaming, tennis, as well as learning new and exciting topics ^_^ 

- Iâ€™m currently in the beginning stages of Data analytics. I have been self-studying SQL first as I feel it is one of the most important tools to have as a data analyst.
  Other topics that I plan on studying include Tableau, Power BI, Excel, and lastly, Python. I have chosen the path of self-learning as I currently do not have the time to
  fit college courses into my schedule ~~and I don't love the idea of being tens of thousands of dollars in debt for the rest of my life.~~
  I have so much that I wish to learn and understand, it's a bit daunting to think about the amount of work that lies ahead, but it's even more frightening to remain stagnant in life.
  
- As for my goals, I am planning to build up my skills mentioned above and eventually use them to enter into the Data field.
