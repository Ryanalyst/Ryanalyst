Hello there dear reader, my name is Ryan Waldrop, and I am an aspiring Data analyst! I currently reside in Mississippi and am self-employed at the moment. My interests are 
sort of all over the place as of late, but to keep it short, I enjoy gaming, tennis, as well as learning new and exciting topics, hence my obsession with data analytics especially haha. There's just so much to learn and I'm eager to do just that.

- Iâ€™m currently in the beginning stages of Data analytics. I have been self-studying SQL first as I feel it is one of the most important tools to have as a data analyst.
- As of me writing this, I have an intermediate level understanding of SQL I feel, perhaps slightly higher. I still have a ways to go before with it, but I'm confident in my
  abilities to learn and apply what I've learned in a professional manner.
- Other topics that I am studying include Tableau, Power BI, Excel, and lastly, Python. I have chosen the path of self-learning as I currently do not have the time to fit college courses into my schedule. I also don't love the idea of being tens of thousands of dollars in debt for the rest of my life haha.
  I have so much that I wish to learn and understand, it's a bit daunting to think about the amount of work that lies ahead, but it's even more frightening to remain stagnant in life.
  
- As for my goals, I plan to build up my skills mentioned above and eventually use them to enter the Data field.
